# By default, Loki will send anonymous, but uniquely-identifiable usage and configuration
# analytics to Grafana. These statistics are sent to https://stats.grafana.org/
#
# Statistics help us better understand how Loki is used, and they show us performance
# levels for most users. This helps us prioritize features and documentation.
# For more information on what's sent: https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/docs/sources/configure/telemetry.md
# Refer to the buildReport method to see what goes into a report.
